by using diff I was able to easily see where a change was made
and what was changed
By having each line next to each other I could very quickly compare the two
it is awesome

Having version history would allow me as a programmer
to look back on all of my attempted code
it would allow me to test things out, discard if they don't work
but still have them saved
Or if I am working on something and make some changes
which break my program, I can go back to determine 
what changed since it was working. 
I could then revise the code to incorporate the older functional code

to compare two documents:
$ git diff <commit id 1> <commit id 2>
