What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a hidden folder that stores the history of all the repository

git diff
compare working directory to staging area

git diff --staged
compare staging area to last commit

git reset --hard
discards unstaged changes

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
by using git diff you can see exactly what has changed to make sure you aren't commiting too much all at once

git branch
shows list of branches

git branch <name of branch>
creates new branch

git checkout <name of branch>
makes that branch the live branch that will receive any commited changes


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

branches help to let you make drastic changes that fork the code and let you maintain the main master branch

git log --graph --oneline <branch name> <branch name>
see branch history

git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
when in an unreachable commit, you can run this command and simultaneously create a new branch and check it out
